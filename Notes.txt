Svelte Lifecycle Hooks:
-----------------------
*onMount        - schedules callback as soon as component is mounted on dom
                - can return a callback that is called when component is unmounted
*onDestroy      - schedule callback to run immediately before component is unmounted
                - similiar to onMount return callback BUT
                - onDestroy works on Server-side rendered components whereas onMount does not
*beforeUpdate   - schedules a callback to run immediately before the component is updated
                - schedules a callback to run immediately after the component has been updated
                - can access the existing DOM before and after an update
* tick          - returns a promise that resolve one any pending state changes have been applied
                - can call any time and not just when the component first initializes
                - it does help when you want to run some code after pending changes have been applied to the DOM
